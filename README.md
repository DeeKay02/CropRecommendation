# CropRecommendation

In this project I will be taking data of different factors 
affecting the production of a plant or a crop like
• N – Ratio of Nitrogen content in the soil
• P – Ratio of Phosphorus content in the soil
• K – Ratio of Potassium content in the soil
• Temperature – Temperature in degree Celsius
• Humidity – Relative Humidity in percentages
• pH – pH value of the soil
• Rainfall – Rainfall in mm
• Label – Names of different crops
And using ML and Visualization techniques to learn and 
do Realtime predictions of suitable crops for given set of 
climatic conditions

If we analyze the data we will be able to predict the best 
crop that can be grown at any given climatic condition 
which will help in a strategized and optimized cultivation 
which results in better and production of crops, increasing 
profits.
