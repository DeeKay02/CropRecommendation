# Optimized Crop Recommendation and Visualization

In this project I will be taking data of different factors  affecting the production of a plant or a crop like<br />
• N – Ratio of Nitrogen content in the soil<br />
• P – Ratio of Phosphorus content in the soil<br />
• K – Ratio of Potassium content in the soil<br />
• Temperature – Temperature in degree Celsius<br />
• Humidity – Relative Humidity in percentages<br />
• pH – pH value of the soil<br />
• Rainfall – Rainfall in mm<br />
• Label – Names of different crops<br />
And using ML and Visualization techniques to learn and do Realtime predictions of suitable crops for given set of climatic conditions

If we analyze the data we will be able to predict the best crop that can be grown at any given climatic condition which will help in a strategized and optimized cultivation which results in better and production of crops, increasing profits.
